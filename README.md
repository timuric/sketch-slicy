###Features:
* Web friendly assets names (lower case letters and whitespace trim)
* Exports layers with similar names
* Assets clean up (Deleted layers/sizes from document automatically being removed from assets folder)
* it is free

###Tutorial:
* Add desired format to the layer or group name to generate an asset, for example: `icon.png`
* `icon.png+@2` - Would generate original asset plus retina version that would be named `icon@2.png`
* `icon.png@2` - Would generate only one asset (which would be double the size)
